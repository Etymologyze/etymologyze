# TODO:

[ ] - Create a server.js file that connects to the API and returns some JSON for us to push to the screen
[ ] - Figure out if we really even need a database, because we're using an API that will accept queries if we just pass the user input into the url
[ ] - Given the above task, consider using surge.sh for hosting. 
[ ] - Consider using a templating language like Handlebars to make page creation simpler and faster.
